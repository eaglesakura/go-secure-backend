# Firebase Auth token verifier

# Google Cloud Platformã€€API Key validator

Validation your API Key, created by Google Cloud Platform.

## Step1. Enable ServiceControl API.

You need [ServiceControl](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/servicecontrol.googleapis.com) API to enable.

## Step2. Deploy Swagger file to Cloud Endpoint.

Deploy your API spec to Cloud Endpoint.

If you not use OpenAPI Based API,
then you can deploy mock file to Endpoint.

```bash
# Init your GCP project.
gcloud init

# deploy
cd path/to/go-secure-backend
./scripts/enable-cloud-endpoint.sh "your-gcp-project-name.appspot.com"
```
## Step3. IAM settings.

You need attach 'servicemanagement.services.check' permission to your service account.
example, you can attach 'Service Controller' role to your Service Account.

## (Option) Step4. API Key security.

You can enable 'restrict key' mode to your API Key on GCP Console.

Go to "GCP Console > APIs & Services > Credentials > (API Key) > API restrictions > Your serviceName"
e.g.) "your-gcp-project.appspot.com" API.
